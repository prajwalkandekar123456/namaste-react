****** NPM *********
--NPM is not stands for node package manager. It is the package manager which manages the packages.
-- NPM is the repository tht contains some packages.

******* Package.json *******
The package.json file is a key part of any Node.js project, including React applications. It acts like a blueprint for your project, providing essential information about the app and helping manage dependencies and scripts. 

******** Bundlers ***********
--- A bundler in React is a tool that takes your JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and other assets, and combines (or "bundles") them into a few optimized files that can be efficiently loaded by a web browser.

--- Why Bundlers are Important
Combines Files: Bundlers take all your individual files and combine them into one or a few files, which reduces the number of HTTP requests the browser needs to make. This speeds up loading times.

--- Handles Dependencies: They resolve dependencies between modules, so if one module requires another, the bundler makes sure they are included in the right order.

--- Optimizes Code: Bundlers can also optimize your code by removing unused code (tree shaking), compressing files (minification), and making other optimizations to improve performance.

--- Popular Bundlers
--- Webpack: The most widely used bundler in the React ecosystem. It is highly configurable and can handle various types of assets with the help of loaders and plugins.\

--- Parcel: A zero-config bundler that works out of the box, offering a simpler setup compared to Webpack.

--- Rollup: Often used for bundling libraries because it generates smaller bundles and supports tree shaking out of the box.

--- Example

When you create a React app using Create React App (CRA), Webpack is used under the hood. Here's a simplified view of what happens:

--- You write your code: You create components and styles in separate files.
--- Webpack processes your code: Webpack takes all these files, processes them (like converting modern JavaScript or JSX into plain JavaScript), and bundles them together.
--- Webpack outputs bundles: It outputs a few optimized files, typically one for JavaScript, one for CSS, etc.
--- Browser loads the bundle: Your browser then loads these few files, rather than hundreds of individual modules.

*** Two types  of dependencies are there ****

** Dev Dependencies:

-- Used only during development.
-- Includes tools for testing, building, and linting.
-- Examples: Jest, Webpack, ESLint.
--Not required in production.

** Normal Dependencies:

-- Needed for the application to run in any environment, including production.
-- Includes libraries and frameworks essential for functionality.
-- Examples: Express, Mongoose, Axios.
Required in both development and production.


********** What is package.lock.json *********
-- package-lock.json is a file used in Node.js projects to manage the dependencies of the project. Here's a simple explanation of its purpose and benefits:

-- Consistency: It ensures that the exact same versions of dependencies are installed every time you (or anyone else) install the project, which helps avoid bugs related to version differences.

-- Speed: It speeds up the installation process because it locks down the versions of dependencies, so npm doesn't need to resolve dependency versions each time you install.

-- Security: It can help with security by locking dependencies to known good versions, avoiding updates that might introduce vulnerabilities.

-- Predictability: It makes the project more predictable by specifying the exact tree of dependencies, so everyone working on the project has the same setup.
